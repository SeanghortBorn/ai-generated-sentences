# AI Model Generated Outputs Repository

This repository stores the generated outputs from five state-of-the-art AI language models:

* **Qwen3-235B-A22B**
* **DeepSeek-V3 (R1)**
* **Claude Sonnet 4**
* **Gemini 2.5 Pro**
* **GPT-4o**

The dataset includes text samples produced by each model based on standardized prompts designed for evaluation and comparison purposes. These outputs are organized to facilitate comprehensive analysis of the models’ performance, quality, and linguistic characteristics across various natural language generation tasks.

## Purpose

The repository serves as a centralized resource for researchers and developers to:

* Compare the linguistic accuracy, diversity, and relevance of different AI models
* Benchmark generative capabilities in specific language tasks
* Support studies on language model strengths and limitations

## Data Generation Details

All outputs stored in this repository were generated by each AI model using the **same standardized prompt**, written in Khmer as follows:

> បង្កើតប្រយោគភាសាខ្មែរចំនួន **១០០** ប្រយោគ ជាមួយនឹងពាក្យ **ករ** មានថ្នាក់ពាក្យជា **ន.** មានន័យថា **ដៃ**។ ពាក្យនេះស្ថិតនៅទីតាំងផ្សេងគ្នានៅក្នុងប្រយោគ ដែលប្រយោគនិមួយៗមានភាពចម្រុះគ្នា មានបរិបទផ្សេងគ្នា កម្រិតភាសាផ្សេងគ្នា និងមានភាពខុសប្លែកគ្នា។ ពេលចាប់ផ្តើមប្រយោគនិមួយៗ កុំរំលងបន្ទាត់ កុំដាក់លេខរៀង ហើយកុំប្រើអក្សរដិតក្នុងប្រយោគ។

(English translation: Create **100** Khmer sentences using the word **ករ** \[kɑː], which is a **noun** meaning **‘hand’**. This word should appear in different positions within the sentences. Each sentence must be diverse in structure, with varying contexts, language levels, and distinctive styles. Do not skip lines between sentences, do not number the sentences, and do not use bold letters in the sentences.)

By using the same prompt across all five AI models—Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3 (R1), Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and GPT-4o—the generated outputs are directly comparable. This setup enables a controlled evaluation of each model’s ability to generate diverse, contextually relevant, and syntactically correct Khmer sentences containing the target keyword.
